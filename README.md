> Due to the lack of a highly rated GitHub repo with Free Open-Sources for PHP Learning, I took it upon myself to compile some
resources to help not only myself but to those that want to learn coding in PHP.

A hands-on PHP learning hub with tutorials, code examples, and mini-projects to guide you from syntax basics to modern web development best practices.

## Installing / Getting Started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a Hello World up & running in VS Code.

```shell
Install "VS Code" and "Xampp"
Ensure the "Environment Variable" is included in "the Path" within Xampp's PHP folder
Install the needed "Extensions for VS Code" [PHP (Bundle) by Devsense, PHP Intelephense by Ben Mewburn, PHP Server by Brapifra, etc]
Other Extensions may include [GitHub, Markdown, Elint/lint, etc] in order to utilize GitHub Version Control and other language syntax
Ensure that the PHP project file/folder you plan to make is within the htdocs folder (.../htdocs/project-name)
Start coding PHP with/without HTML
You can right-click the code and use the following: [PHP Server: Live, Reload, Stop]
```

Congrats! You just created your first PHP "Hello World" file and there's so much more you can do with just PHP so experiement to your hearts content!

### Initial Configuration

Requirements:
  
- Ensure that the PHP project file/folder you plan to make is within the htdocs folder (.../htdocs/project-name).
  
- Ensure you have a GitHub account to make project repos and save changes to prevent loss of progress with your code in the future.

## Developing

In order to start developing the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
cd project-name/
```

After setting up GitHub and the GitHub repo, you should be able to clone/commit/publish your progress as you make changes to the PHP project.

### Building

To build the project after some code changes:

```shell
commit changes by using the GitHub extensions from VS Code or by using the terminal via commands
stash/push the changes into the main/master branch of the project or in another branch if needed
```

After commiting and pushing the changes into GitHub, you should see the project repo change to reflect the most recent code.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case you want to publish your project to a server:

```shell
Ensure that the project is fully functional and give appropiate credit to all contributors/authors.
Provide a step-by-step process of how you managed to complete the project.
Check the project and live server before finalizing the project status.
```

If you want to use GitHub pages or any other 3rd party platform for your server, you can but it may prove to be difficult with the lack of updated PHP tutorials for all sorts of software services. 
[You can checkout the masterPortfolio repo to see how to use GitHub pages]
